## Planned maintenance

Planned maintenance work is announced in advance via our [freistil Ops newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/freistilops). To get important announcements delivered directly to your email inbox, please follow the link and subscribe! (We'll never send anything other than important technical information.)


## Outages

In the case we experience a severe outage that impacts the operation of one or more websites and lasts longer than a few minutes, we will inform you via our [Status Blog](http://status.freistil.it). To be up-to-date at every time, you should subscribe to the blog's RSS feed. We recommend you also follow [@freistilops](https://twitter.com/#!/freistilops) on Twitter.


## Product roadmap

We're always busy adding new features, developing improvements and fixing known problems. To give you a glimpse into what we're working on, we're curating a [product roadmap](http://roadmap.freistilbox.com) for freistilbox. You're welcome to add comments and vote for projects you like!
