<p>Our Help Center team is there to help you with any question or problem you encounter while using freistilbox.</p>

<h2 id="support-levels">Support levels</h2>

<p>We offer two support levels, Standard Support and Premium Support. Standard Support is available “12x5”, weekdays from 06:00 to 18:00 (UTC).</p>

<p>With a Premium Support contract, you can reach our on-call support “24x7” — around the clock on any day. (Due to our limited on-call capacity, support outside the 12x5 timeframe applies exclusively to production emergencies.) Premium Support comes with even more advantages, and you can find all the details on the <a href="http://www.freistilbox.com/support-levels/">freistilbox website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-to-premium-support">Upgrading to Premium Support</h3>

<p>You can upgrade from Standard Support to Premium Support at any time. We will invoice you for the monthly Premium Support fee starting from the month of your upgrade.</p>

<p>An upgrade is even possible when you’re issuing a new support request. For example, let’s assume that your freistilbox cluster has Standard Support and you encounter a critical problem during the weekend. If you decide to take advantage of our Premium Support and have our engineers start working immediately on this issue, simply say so in your support request.</p>

<h2 id="support-channels">Support channels</h2>

<p>You can reach our Help Center team via several channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>web: our <a href="http://freistil.zendesk.com">Help Center website</a></li>
  <li>email: our Help Center address <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#102;&#114;&#101;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#105;&#116;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#102;&#114;&#101;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#105;&#116;</a></li>
  <li>phone: our Help Center hotline <a href="tel://+4976145895599">+49 761 458 955 99</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of the channel you use to reach out to us, each (non-trivial) support request will be documented in a dedicated support ticket. Each ticket has a unique ID number that makes it easy to reference. All questions and comments regarding the issue at hand will be stored in this ticket, so they can be revisited at any time with complete context.</p>

<p>To make it easy to track — for you as well as for us — which aspects of your support requests are already handled and which ones still need action, we ask you to separate each different topic into a dedicated support request. <strong>Please do not mix unrelated topics in a single ticket</strong> since it will become confusing very quickly.</p>

<h3 id="contact-via-web">Contact via web</h3>

<p>To manage your support requests in your web browser, simply visit our <a href="http://freistil.zendesk.com">Help Center website</a>. You can create your own user account there if you don’t already have one. Then, just click the “New ticket” link to issue a new support request.</p>

<h3 id="contact-via-email">Contact via email</h3>

<p>To send us your support request via email, write to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#102;&#114;&#101;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#105;&#116;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#102;&#114;&#101;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#105;&#116;</a>. The Help Center website will automatically create a new ticket and notify you of the new ticket ID in an email response.</p>

<p>By replying to an Help Center email, you can add comments to the ticket. Please do not remove the ticket ID from the email subject because the Help Center would then store your response in a newly created ticket instead of adding it to the existing one.</p>

<h3 id="contact-via-phone">Contact via phone</h3>

<p>If you decide to call us, you can speed up the support process by first issuing a written new support request. Otherwise, the Help Center agent will create a new ticket for you by asking you for the essential details explained in the next section.</p>

<p>Outside of the 12x5 timeframe, you will be connected to our Help Center voicemail system. To save yourself the effort of recording all the problem details explained below, please provide them to us in a written support request and then simply leave us the ticket ID on voicemail. Your message will be sent immediately to our on-call engineers who will get back to you immediately after reviewing your support ticket.</p>

<h2 id="essential-details">Essential details</h2>

<p>If you need to report a problem, please try to answer the following questions as precise as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>WHAT:</strong> What are the symptoms of the problem?</li>
  <li><strong>WHERE:</strong> Which websites are affected by the problem? If possible, mention the site ID of at least one affected website.</li>
  <li><strong>WHEN:</strong> When was the problem first detected and, if it was only temporary, when did it end?</li>
  <li><strong>WHO:</strong> What are your email address and your phone number? The best place to provide us with this information is your Help Center user account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example support request that covers all the essential details:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[WHAT:] We noticed error messages (“error 503”) [WHERE:] on our website www.example.com (site ID s007). [WHEN:] The problem started circa 14:20 CET and at 14:35, the site started working okay again. [WHO:] Please contact me via email at mail@example.com or via phone 123456”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In similar fashion, if you just have a question or need us to perform a certain task (for example, a change to your hosting configuration), make sure to give us as much information as possible from the start. The fewer roundtrips we need to clarify the issue, the faster we’ll be able to finish your support request.</p>
